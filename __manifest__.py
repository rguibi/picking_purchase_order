Manage loans by Employees
============================

This application allows you to manage your employees' loans. It gives you access to your employeesâ€™ fee notes and give you the right to complete and validate or refuse the notes. After validation it creates a cash ticket for the employee.
Employee can encode their own loans and the validation flow puts it automatically in the cash after validation by managers.

---------------------------------
* Draft loan
* Submitted by the employee to his manager
* Approved by his manager
* Validation by the accountant and cash entries creation
